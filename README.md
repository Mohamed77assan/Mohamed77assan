## Understanding Binary Categorical Variables

When working with categorical variables in machine learning, it's common to represent them numerically. One popular method is called one-hot encoding, where each category is converted into a binary variable (0 or 1).

However, if a categorical variable has only two categories (binary), one-hot encoding is unnecessary. Instead, a single binary variable can be used to represent both categories. For instance:

- Category A could be represented as 0
- Category B could be represented as 1

Since there are only two categories, one variable is sufficient to capture them both.

This approach simplifies the data representation and can improve computational efficiency. Remember, when dealing with binary categorical variables, there's no need for one-hot encoding.
